# Installing

After creating a Mudlet profile to connect to Accursed Lands, add the package by:

1.    Downloading a release of this package (the .mpackage file) from the [releases page](https://github.com/Accursed-Lands-MUD/AL-GUI-for-Mudlet/releases)
2.    Open the Package Manager in Mudlet (alt-o)
- If present, uninstall the generic-mapper package. It may conflict with the one provided here.

# Notes and Best Practices
If you are getting weird characters such as ï¿½, your Mudlet client is probably configured for ASCII server encoding.  Change it to UTF-8 (recommended)

For Points of Interest that have multiple/different exits or are larger than 1 wilderness tile...

- The auto-mapper will work fine if you have the wilderness area mapped around the exits ahead of time. 

- However, if you exit a POI into an unmapped wilderness area, it will create a new room in a weird place causing a visually disjointed map. 

- This has to be manually fixed by the player experiencing the problem.
